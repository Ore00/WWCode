Project Epic:
As a couple, we want to share key details about our upcoming wedding events so family and friends may RSVP.

As a couple, we want to easily obtain the total RSVPs for each activity without having to compile a list.

As a couple, we want to easily export a list of RSVPs, so we can know who to expect for our wedding events.

As an attendee, I want confirmation of my RSVP, so that I know the couple knows my intentions.

Homework Epic:
As a nonattender, I want information about where I can send a gift to the couple, so they will know I wish them well although I canâ€™t attend

  Add the tables using file setup/wwc_wedding.sql
